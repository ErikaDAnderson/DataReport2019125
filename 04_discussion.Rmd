# DISCUSSION

This ecosystem-based juvenile Pacific Salmon survey collected valuable information on distribution, abundance, condition, and genetic stock composition (GSI) for juvenile Pacific Salmon `r surveyRegion`. Overall, juvenile Pink Salmon and Chum Salmon and were most abundant, whereas Coho Salmon were least abundant. Distributions and stomach contents varied by species. The most abundant prey species were amphiipods, euphausiids, and Pacific Herring, depending on the predator species. We collected `r nrow(ctd_orig)` physical oceanographic water profiles, and `r nrow(planktonvert)` zooplankton samples associated with the Pacific Salmon caught. Select data from laboratory analysis (i.e. GSI, energy density) has been completed and will integrated into the survey data. Other items are awaiting analysis (i.e. zooplankton composition, isotopic analysis). This survey data supplements historic juvenile Pacific Salmon surveys, have been reported in Fisheries and Oceans Canada [State of the Pacific Ocean](https://dfo-mpo.gc.ca/oceans/publications/index-eng.html#soto-pac-tech) report, and will be incorporated into longer term research projects.
