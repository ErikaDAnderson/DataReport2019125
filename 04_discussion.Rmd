# DISCUSSION

This ecosystem-based juvenile Pacific Salmon survey collected valuable information on distribution, abundance, condition, and genetic stock composition (GSI) for juvenile Pacific Salmon `r surveyRegion`. Overall, juvenile Pink Salmon and Chum Salmon and were most abundant, whereas Coho Salmon were least abundant. Distributions and stomach contents varied by species. The most abundant prey species were amphiipods, euphausiids, and Pacific Herring, depending on the predator species. We collected physical oceanographic water profiles, and zooplankton abundance and composition associated with the Pacific Salmon caught. The data from laboratory analysis (i.e. GSI, energy density, zooplankton composition) has been integrated into the survey data. These catch data, along with condition and GSI data, supplement historic juvenile Pacific Salmon surveys in these areas and have been reported in Fisheries and Oceans Canada [State of the Pacific Ocean](https://dfo-mpo.gc.ca/oceans/publications/index-eng.html#soto-pac-tech) report. *not really sockeye forcasting, but what else specifically?*
