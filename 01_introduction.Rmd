# INTRODUCTION

Fisheries and Oceans Canada conducted an ecosystem-based survey, targeting juvenile Pacific Salmon (*Oncorhynchus* spp.) from `r surveyDateRange` on the *`r vessel`*. The main objectives of this surveys were:

1. to determine the abundance, condition, distribution, and genetic stock composition of juvenile Pacific Salmon present `r surveyRegion` in the fall,  

2. the associated physical oceanography, and


3. the distribution and biomass of prey species, including zooplankton.

This survey supports research into linkages between oceanographic conditions, fish abundance and community composition, Pacific Salmon ocean ecology and forecasting adult returns. This data report documents the biological, oceanographic, and zooplankton data and samples collected during the `r surveyName` from `r surveyDateRange`.
